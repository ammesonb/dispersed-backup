# Dispersed Backup
Based on the principles of [my other project in Python](https://github.com/ammesonb/logical-backup), but using Go which seems to be a more appropriate language.

I also intend to add a local web interface for this, which should be more intuitive than a CLI version (though that will still be supported, albeit in a different fashion).
