- Logs as modal, filterable by level, timestamps etc
    - By worker, if possible
- UI has completed, in progress, pending sections (with pretty animated icons)
- Completed section can be cleared
- Multi-select option? for actions
- Rearrange using grab bar, maybe support touch actions?
- Need an options section
- Show hard drive fill percents
- Report progress natively, showing via filling a bar in the "In Progress" section
    - How to do, if disk operations are shifted to separate processes?
    - Local UDP socket, per-worker?
- Dedicated channels for logging, device availability, etc
    - Buffered to 100 or something large, to avoid issues with changes in thread/worker counts
- How to update disk availability after each write (check availability only decreased by file size, not file size + 4k for block alignment etc)?
    - May not be possible since other writes will almost certainly be in progress
    - If nothing in progress, can re-check availability - use tick, check "in progress" set

- When command added, main thread owns it ("pending" queue)
- When passed off, worker owns it ("in progress" queue)
    - Communicated back to main thread using a status update
- Upon completion, ownership passed back to main thread ("completed" queue)
